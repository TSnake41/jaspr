Follow the steps to install it, and _\"TAA-DAM\"_, JaspR is now on your computer ! Extra-easy, isn't it ?\r\n\r\nThere's also a forum topic of JaspR on [batch.xoo.it](http://batch.xoo.it/t5194-JaspR.htm), I really recommend you to check this out if you are interessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \"Alright, JaspR is installed, now how do I use it ?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the installation, you should find two shortcuts named \"JaspR (x86)\" and \"JaspR (x64)\" on your desktop. Launch the one which correspond to your processor's architecture. If you have a 32 bits version of Windows, then launch \"JaspR (x86)\". Else, if you have a 64 bits version of Windows, launch \"JaspR (x64)\".\r\n\r\nTwo windows appear on your screen :\r\n\r\n![JaspR main menu screenshot](//a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/jaspr/screenshots/screenshot1.jpg)\r\nThis is the main menu window. Here, you just have to select which items JaspR will clean for you, and choose if you want to analyze the amount of data that you could save, or clean directly it.\r\n\r\n![JaspR console screenshot](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/jaspr/screenshots/screenshot2.jpg)\r\nThis is the other window. It's a console in which you will see the process progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any question, remark or suggestion about JaspR, contact me : raph.berteaud@gmail.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![JaspR icon](https://sourceforge.net/p/jaspr/jaspr/ci/master/tree/SOURCE/JaspR%201.0/JaspRico.ico?format=raw)",
