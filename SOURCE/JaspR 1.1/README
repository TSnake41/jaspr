WHAT'S NEW :

-Flexibility improvement : You can now rename the source code file (default is "JaspR [version].bat")

-Now JaspR uses his own subfolder under the local applications data's folder to store source code and icon.

-JaspR checks if AgrafV2 exists, if not, an error message appears.

-JaspR stores user's choices in variables (so remembers which boxes user's ticked)

-Suppression and analysis algorithm improvement


-The source code is the "JaspR 1.0.bat" file.

It's a batch file (you must must run it as administrator to use it)



-"AgrafV2.exe" is a dependency of JaspR : AgrafV2 is used in JaspR to get the GUI.

Without AgrafV2, JaspR will exit immediately / will just not work.

You must have AgrafV2.exe in C:\windows\system32 or in the folder where the "JaspR 1.0.bat" is.



-"JaspRico.ico" is the icon which will be shown on JaspR GUI.

It's not needed, but will be cleaner.



NOTE : "AgrafV2.exe" and "JaspRico.ico" should NEVER be renamed.
