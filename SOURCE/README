-The source code is the "JaspR 1.0.bat" file.

It's a batch file (you must must run it as administrator to use it)



-"AgrafV2.exe" is a dependency of JaspR : AgrafV2 is used in JaspR to get the GUI.

Without AgrafV2, JaspR will exit immediately / will just not work.

You must have AgrafV2.exe in C:\windows\system32 or in the folder where the "JaspR 1.0.bat" is.



-"JaspRico.ico" is the icon which will be shown on JaspR GUI.

It's not needed, but will be cleaner.



NOTE : "AgrafV2.exe" and "JaspRico.ico" should NEVER be renamed.
